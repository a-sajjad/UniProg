This project is originally developed for our Software Engineering Course (ITC 315) project to practice the software development life-cycle, 
software development practices, and different but related methodologies. The Scrum model suggests that projects progress via a series of sprints. 
In keeping with an agile methodology, sprints are timeboxed to no more than a month long, most commonly two weeks.  

Scrum methodology advocates for a planning meeting at the start of the sprint, where team members figure out how many items they can commit to, 
and then create a sprint backlog â€“ a list of the tasks to perform during the sprint.
