#### A GUI Toolkit for Students to Manage their Degree Plan and Courses

```
This project is originally developed for our Software Engineering Course.
The intention of this project to practice the software development life-cycle, software development 
practices, and different but related methodologies. 
The Scrum model suggests that projects progress via a series of sprints.  
In keeping with an agile methodology, sprints are timeboxed to 
no more than a month long, most commonly two weeks.

Scrum methodology advocates for a planning meeting at the start of the sprint,
where team members figure out how many items they can commit to, 
and then create a sprint backlog â€“ a list of the tasks to perform during the sprint.
